# CMPA™

The **CMPA™ (Counterintelligence Methodology for Phishing Attacks)** is an **Open Framework** designed for **Threat Intelligence teams**.
Its goal is to provide **holistic visibility** into an organization’s **threat ecosystem**, with a primary focus on **Phishing Campaigns** — one of the main vectors of cyber threats.

With **CMPA™**, it is possible to collect and analyze the following information:

* Behavioral patterns of targeted attacks
* Correlation of characteristics within **Threat Actors’ infrastructures**
* Generation of **IOCs** (Indicators of Compromise) with a higher level of depth
* Correlation of IOCs across multiple campaigns to identify the **Threat Actors’ original infrastructure**
* Holistic visibility of the threat ecosystem **intrinsic to MITRE ATT&CK technique T1660**
* Continuous **feedback and enrichment** of the intelligence base with **new phishing attack strategies**
